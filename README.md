## 📜 Introduction

This project is an implementation of Conway's famous **"Game of Life"**, built with Rust and the Bevy game engine. It's my first Rust project, created to learn the basics of the language.

## ✨ Features

- 🔲 Configurable grid size (currently 50x25)
- 🎨 Minimalist graphical interface with Bevy
- ⏱️ Simulation time control
- 🎲 Random cell generation
- 🖱️ Ability to place/remove cells with the mouse

## 🎯 Game Rules

The Game of Life follows simple but fascinating rules:

1. A living cell with fewer than 2 living neighbors dies (underpopulation)
2. A living cell with 2 or 3 living neighbors survives
3. A living cell with more than 3 living neighbors dies (overpopulation)
4. A dead cell with exactly 3 living neighbors becomes alive (reproduction)

## 🕹️ Controls

| Key | Action |
|--------|--------|
| `Space` | Pause/Resume simulation |
| `R` | Reset with random configuration |
| `C` | Clear all cells |
| `Left click` | Create/Delete a cell |
